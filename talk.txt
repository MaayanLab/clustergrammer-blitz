1. Title
  Hi, I'm Nicolas and I'll be discussing my project, Clustergrammer, a web-based visualization and analysis tool for high-dimensional biological data.

  This presentation can be found at this link - bitly/clust-blitz (this link will be left up)

2. Biology is Overflowing with Data
  Biology is overflowing with data. It is possible to measure the expression of tens of thousands of genes, thousands of proteins, and hundreds of thousands of single cells using high-throughput experiments.

3. Biological Data is Difficult to Visualize
  Becuse biological data is very high dimensional it can be very difficult to visualize and this can lead to hairballs.

4. Heatmap/Clustergram Visualizations (Part 1)
  Heatmaps are a popular visualization technique that allow direct visualization of high-dimensional data withoug the loss of interpretability associated with dimensionality reduction methods.

  In a heatmap data-points are shown as columns and dimensions are shown as rows. In this example, the data-points are patients and the dimensions are genes.

5. Heatmap/Clustergram Visualizations (Part 2)
  However, it is currently difficult to generate web-based interactive heatmaps and sharing static images limits usability.

  For instance, there is effectively no limit to the number of data-points or dimensions that we can show, but a static visualization becomes almost unusable once we can not read the labels.

6. Clustergrammer Web App
  Clustergrammer is a web app that allows users to upload a matrix and instantly generate an interactive and shareable clustergram.

  The visualizations produced by clustergrammer are highly interactive and allow: zooming, reordering, filtering, etc.

7. Lung Cancer Post-translations
  We have used clustergrammer to analyze a unique data set from our collaborators at Cell Signaling Technology. Our collaborators have measured differential phosphorylation in 42 lung cancer cell lines.

  Here is an example visualization of this data. We can see that the cell lines cluster based on their histology, but not gender. We can also see that several clusters of phosphorylations form and can be associated with different sets of cell lines.

8. Lung Cancer Gene Expression
  Gene expression data for these cell lines was also obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. From this data we can also see that cell lines cluster based on histology and identify clusters of differentially regulated genes.

9. Acknowledgments and links
  I would like to acknowledge the Ma'ayan lab.


CST notes:
  Our collaborators at Cell Signaling Technology Inc. used SILAC phosphoproteomics to measure differential phosphorylation in a panel of 42 lung cancer cell lines compared to non-cancerous lung cells.

  We are collaborating with Cell Signaling Technologies, who in addition to producing antibodies also conduct independent resaerch. We are helping them analyze a very unique dataset from a panel of 32 lung cancer cell lines. They have used SILAC mass spectrometry to measure phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation. This dataset offers a very unique view of the mechanisms involved in lung cancer and offers a unique set of challenges in analyzing - there is a great deal of missing data for instance. (mention that they are measuring differential modification from these cell lines compared to non-cancerous lung tissue).

  Here is a heatmap view of phosphorylation that shows several clusters of lung cell lines as well as their defining differential phosphorylation.
