1. Title
  Hi, I'm Nicolas and I'll be discussing my project, Clustergrammer, a web-based visualization and analysis tool for high-dimensional biological data.

  This presentation can be found at this bitly link - bitly/clust-blitz if you are interested in following along. I'll leave this link up for a few slides.

2. Biology is Overflowing with Data
  Biology is overflowing with data. Using high-throughput techniques, it is possible to measure the expression of tens of thousands of genes, the levels of thousands of proteins, and dozens of parameters in hundreds of thousands of single cells.

3. Biological Data is Difficult to Visualize
  However, becuse biological data can be very high dimensional it can be very difficult to visualize. This can lead to hairballs, which are incomprehensible representations of complicated biological networks.

4. Heatmap/Clustergram Visualizations (Part 1)
  Heatmaps are a popular visualization technique that enable direct visualization of high-dimensional data. Unlike dimensionality reduction methods, there is no loss of interpretability with a heatmap.

  In a heatmap data-points are shown as columns and dimensions are shown as rows. In this example, the data-points are patients and the dimensions are genes.

5. Heatmap/Clustergram Visualizations (Part 2)
  However, static images are limited in the amount of information they can readily visualize and sharing interactive clustergrams is difficult.

6. Clustergrammer Web App
  Clustergrammer is a web app that allows users to upload a matrix and instantly generate an interactive and shareable clustergram.

  The visualizations produced by clustergrammer are highly interactive and allow: zooming, reordering, filtering, etc.

7. Lung Cancer Post-translational Modification Signaling
  We have used clustergrammer to analyze a unique data set from our collaborators at Cell Signaling Technology. Our collaborators have measured differential phosphorylation in 42 lung cancer cell lines compared to noncancerous lung cells.

  Here is an example visualization of cell lines clustered based on phosphorylation. We can see that cell lines cluster according to their histology, but not gender. We can also see that several clusters of phosphorylations form and can be associated with different sets of cell lines.

8. Lung Cancer Gene Expression
  Gene expression data for these cell lines was also obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. From this data we can see that cell lines also cluster accodring to their histology and we can identify clusters of differentially regulated genes.

9. Acknowledgments and links
  I would like to acknowledge the Ma'ayan lab, Cell Signaling Technology.


CST notes:
  Our collaborators at Cell Signaling Technology Inc. used SILAC phosphoproteomics to measure differential phosphorylation in a panel of 42 lung cancer cell lines compared to non-cancerous lung cells.

  We are collaborating with Cell Signaling Technologies, who in addition to producing antibodies also conduct independent resaerch. We are helping them analyze a very unique dataset from a panel of 32 lung cancer cell lines. They have used SILAC mass spectrometry to measure phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation. This dataset offers a very unique view of the mechanisms involved in lung cancer and offers a unique set of challenges in analyzing - there is a great deal of missing data for instance. (mention that they are measuring differential modification from these cell lines compared to non-cancerous lung tissue).

  Here is a heatmap view of phosphorylation that shows several clusters of lung cell lines as well as their defining differential phosphorylation.
